    <p>
      I remember again like 1 year or 2 years ago when I had so much free time and doing everything that I wanted
      without any worries, playing video games and everything. But everything changed the day I decided to stop 
      being comfortable and do what I actually like, I had give away my ps4 buy me a computer and start learning 
      code online. I was more into codecademy than anything else. But so far I know some basic of html , css and js.
      but to be honest, I love js  more than anything else.
      but what I like to do on my free times are, coding, watching videos about code, salaries, the tech industry
      just anything that has to do with software engineering.
